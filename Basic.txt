## Advanced Math Test:
##{1d100+3} rolls a d100 and adds 3 to the answer
##{42+69} does math! 42+69=111
##{{4d8}+{8d8}} rolls multiple dice and adds them together
##{1d100-3} rolls a d100 and subtracts 3 from the answer
##{42-69} does math! 42-69=-27
##{42--69} picks a random number from 42 to 69
##{1d100*3} rolls a d100 and multiplies the answer by 3
##{1d100/3} rolls a d100 and divides the answer by 3. This will give you the accurate floating point calculation.
##{max(10, 50, 20)} returns the max value of a list of numbers.
##{min(10, 50, 20)} returns the min value of a list of numbers.
##{avg(10, 50, 20)} returns the average of a list of numbers.
##{sqrt(25)} returns the square root of a number.
##{abs(-10)} returns the absolute value of a number.
##{floor(10.9)} is rounded down.
##{ceil(10.1)} is rounded up.
##{sign(-5)} returns -1 for negative numbers, or 1 for positive numbers.

##In-line random pick: [|Happy|Sad|Angry|Confused|]
##[@PickMe] will draw a random item from the PickMe table
##[@{1d20} PickMe] will roll a 1d20 and draw that many random items from the PickMe table
##{1d[@dietype]} is a nested dice roll. It picks a random number from the dietype table, and uses it to roll a dice with that many sides.
##[@5 Table >> sort] will pick multiple items from a table and sort them numerically or alphabetically before output.
##To pick multiple items from a table and separate each pick with a comma, use implode (Put delimiters in quotes): [@4 Table >> sort >> implode ", "]
##Captialize the first letter of a word with >> proper
##lowercase a word with >> lower
##CAPITAL LETTERS with >> upper
